# Question

Write a function that, given:

- an amount of money
- an array of coin denominations
- computes the number of ways to make the amount of money with coins of the available denominations.

Example: for `const amount = 4;` (4¢) and `const denominations = [1, 2, 3];`(1¢, 2¢ and 3¢), your program would output 4 — the number of ways to make 4¢ with those denominations:

```
1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
1¢, 1¢, 2¢
1¢, 3¢
2¢, 2¢
```

# Answer

```javascript
const compute = (amount = 4, denominations = [1,2,3]) => {
  if (amount === 0) { return 1; }
  if (amount < 0) { return 0; }

  let ways = 0;
  let coins2 = new Set(denominations)
  for (const coin of denominations) {
    coins2.delete(coin)
    for (let i = 1; amount - coin*i >= 0; i++) {
      ways += makeChange(amount - coin*i, coins2);
    }
  }
  return ways;
}
console.log(compute());
```
